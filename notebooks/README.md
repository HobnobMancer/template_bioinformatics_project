# README.md `notebooks`

The `notebooks` folder might contain examples of [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) or [`RMarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notebooks. These notebook formats are powerful, dynamic documents that interleave code and text. They can be very useful for:

- working through problems as a kind of "sketchpad"
- host supplementary material that is too large to include in a report or thesis
- present detailed methodologies, including commands that can be copied and executed for reproducibility
- presenting analyses elegantly in a static way
- presenting complex ideas or analyses with the code and data being analysed, so that the analysis can be modified and the effects of the changes seen immediately
- presenting interactive analyses with dynamic widgets
- writing webpages showing your work and analysis
- reusing ideas and analyses with new datasets
- presenting the entire analysis or thesis in an interactive book form

among other uses

These could be organised in many different ways: one subfolder per kind of notebook; a different subfolder for each topic addressed; no subfolders; and so on.


## Quick guide

Below is a quick brief summary on how to set up and present `notebooks` as interative HTML pages.

1. Save the `notebook` as HTML pages
2. Add and commit the HTML pages to the GitHub repository
3. Add a link in the main landing `README.md` file or from another intersitital webpage to the HTML page built by GitHub Page.

> **_NOTE:_**  HTML pages built by GitHub Page use a different URL structure to the GitHub repository. GitHub repositories use the `https://github.com/<user_name>/<repo_name>` format, whereas pages built by GitHub Page use the `https://<user_name>.github.io/<repo_name>` format.
