# README.md `MSc_bioinformatics_project_template`

This repository is a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) intended to make it simpler for MSc bioinformatic project students to get started with their own GitHub repositories.

## How to use this repository

This repository is a _template_. It does not contain any project information itself, but it does lay out a directory structure with a minimal skeleton of explanatory `README.md` files explaining the motivation behind each the project structure.

These files can - and should - be modified for your own project. For example, **this `README.md` file is a landing page for the project, explaining what it is, why it exists, and how to use it.** Your project repository should have a `README.md` file in this location that performs this task _for your project_.

### Creating a new repository

To create a new repository from this template:

1. Log in to GitHub at [`https://github.com`](https://github.com)
2. Use your browser to navigate to the GitHub page for this repository: []()
3. Click on the `Use This Template` button
4. Click on the `Owner` drop-down menu, and select the account you would like to own the new repository (this will most likely be your account)
5. Type the name of the repository you want to create into the `Repository Name` field.
6. Add a short description of your repository (or your project) in the `Description` field.
7. Choose whether your repository should be `Public` (anyone can see or clone it), `Private` (only you and those you authorise can see or clone it), or `Internal` (this is probably not relevant to you)
8. Click `Create Repository from Template`

This will create a new repository in your `GitHub` account, and this should be visible from your account page. You can then clone this repository to your machine, or work with it in the browser.

The official guidance for creating a new repository can be found on GitHub at the link below.

## Why should you use this repository?

This was written specifically for people working on their first (or an early) bioinformatics or computational biology project, and who would like some help setting up their project structure so that it follows good practice and keeps files, code and data in order.

If you are already very familiar with building your own project repositories with `git` and GitHub, or you have experience with good practice in this kind of project structure, this template may not be of as much use to you. But it might save some time if it aligns well with your preferred way of working.
