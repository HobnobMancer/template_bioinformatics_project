# README.md `bioinformatics_project_template`

This repository is a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) intended to make it simpler for undergraduate and postgraduate bioinformatic project students to get started with their own `git` and GitHub repositories.

## Why should you use this repository?

This template was written specifically to assist people working on their first (or an early) bioinformatics or computational biology project, and who would like some help setting up their project structure so that it follows good practice and keeps files, code and data in order.

If you are already very familiar with building your own project repositories with `git` and GitHub, or you have experience with good practice in this kind of project structure, this template may not be of as much use to you. But it might save some time if it aligns well with your preferred way of working.

## How to use this repository

This repository is a _template_. It does not contain any project information itself, but it does lay out a directory structure with a minimal skeleton of explanatory `README.md` files explaining the motivation behind each directory in the project structure.

These files can - and should - be modified for your own project. For example, **this `README.md` file is a landing page for the project, explaining what it is, why it exists, and how to use it.** Your project repository should replace this `README.md` file with information that performs the same task _for your project_.

The same applies to the subdirectories under this _project root_ folder

### Creating a new repository

To create a new repository from this template:

1. Log in to GitHub at [`https://github.com`](https://github.com)
2. Use your browser to navigate to the GitHub page for this repository: [https://github.com/sipbs-compbiol/template_bioinformatics_project](https://github.com/sipbs-compbiol/template_bioinformatics_project)
3. Click on the `Use This Template` button

4. Click on the `Owner` drop-down menu, and select the account you would like to own the new repository (this will most likely be your own account)
5. Type the name of the repository you want to create into the `Repository Name` field.
6. Add a short description of your repository (or your project) in the `Description` field.
7. Choose whether your repository should be `Public` (anyone can see or clone it), `Private` (only you and those you authorise can see or clone it), or `Internal` (this is probably not relevant to you, and can be ignored)
8. Click `Create Repository from Template`

This will create a new repository in your `GitHub` account, which should be visible from your account page. You can then clone this repository to your machine, or work with it in the browser.

## Repository layout

This repository follows the guidance in [Noble, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) as a starting point. There are a few small changes with respect to that manuscript's example, but you are free to modify the folders and the files they contain, to suit your own purposes.
